## About Me

Hello, my name is Mengyi Lu.  I got my master's degree from <a href="https://www.blcu.edu/" target="_blank"> Beijing Language and Culture University</a> in 2020, focusing on natural language processing.
I worked under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://liupengyuan.github.io/" target="_blank"> Liu Pengyuan</a>. My research involves relation extraction, question-answering systems, and semantic analysis.

From 2021 to 2023, I worked as an algorithm engineer in the <a href="https://www.soundai.com/" target="_blank"> Weibo Advertising Recommendation Group</a>, responsible for ad ranking model optimization, user behavior analysis and mining, and text content mining.

From 2020 to 2021, I worked as a natural language processing algorithm engineer at <a href="https://www.soundai.com/" target="_blank"> SoundAI Technology Company</a>. I was mainly responsible for the intelligent dialogue system and music recommendation service in the smart speaker project.


Outside of academia and industry, I have worked part-time as a photographer, serving hundreds of clients. Additionally, I worked as an outdoor guide in Beijing. I’m also passionate about running. I have completed three marathons and multiple half-marathons. I also have a keen interest in cooking, reading, and writing.
